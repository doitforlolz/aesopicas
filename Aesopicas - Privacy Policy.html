  <li class="li2"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>Final Note to Parents and Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy<br>
</b></span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Internet offers a world of opportunity for children. Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. We encourage you to stay involved in and informed about what your child is doing online. Your efforts to instill responsible information practices will help steer your children to age-appropriate sites and will go a long way toward ensuring that your children have enriching experiences online.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Aesopicas takes special care to ensure the privacy of users who are children under the age of 13. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years of age without the express authorization of a parent or guardian.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">COPPA: Aesopicas adheres to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). COPPA is a law in the United States that regulates the way in which online Websites may collect and use information from children. We do not collect or use information in a manner that is inconsistent with the COPPA. In fact, as stated fully below, no personal information is required from you to visit our Sites. For more information on the COPPA please visit Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule ("COPPA") or consult this simple one-page informational guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Consent: COPPA requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Sites. Parents/guardians of children under the age of 13 can consent to this Privacy Policy by printing and mailing us a signed and dated form expressly consenting to this Privacy Policy. Additionally, the payment of a subscription for Aesopicas Services to Aesopicas, including the use of a credit card, will be considered express consent to this Privacy Policy. Electronic signatures will not be sufficient to confer consent.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Parental Participation in Online Activities: Parents are strongly encouraged to participate in their children’s online activities and monitor their children’s use of e-mails and engagement in other electronic communication. Please help us protect your child's privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without your permission.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We encourage parents to visit the GetNetWise.org site and look through the "Kids Safety" section together.
