<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Terms &amp; Conditions</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Aesopicas.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Aesopicas is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Aesopicas app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Aesopicas app won’t work properly or at all.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You should be aware that there are certain things that Aesopicas will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Aesopicas cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Along the same lines, Aesopicas cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Aesopicas cannot accept responsibility.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">With respect to Aesopicas’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Aesopicas accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Aesopicas does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</span></p>

All fees are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time when the fee becomes payable.

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You must use a credit card, payment via the App Store, or other payment mechanism accepted by us to activate and maintain a paid account. You authorize Aesopicas to charge you through the payment mechanism that you use when you register for access to Aesopicas. You are also responsible for charges for any products or Services you order that are offered for sale through our Sites. If we do not receive payment via your payment mechanism, you agree to pay all amounts due hereunder upon our demand, and will be solely responsible for any dispute with your payment provider. If the payment method provided is initially declined for any reason, we reserve the right to charge the payment method (credit card or other accepted mechanism) in installments, at the non-promotional/non-discounted rate that is in place at the time, for the full duration of the subscription that you have selected.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Subscriptions purchased inside our Aesopicas app are managed directly by the applicable App Store. You should consult with the appropriate App Store to determine if the price charged includes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. Aesopicas relies on the App Store to collect subscription fees and to report on the status of subscription accounts that have been purchased from within the app. Aesopicas does not have the ability to manage any aspect of an App Store subscription on your behalf, including, but not limited to, initiating, canceling or refunding subscriptions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Subscriptions are valid for at least thirty (30) days. Payment for a subscription will be charged to your App Store account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least twenty-four (24)hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged the then-applicable subscription price within twenty-four (24) hours prior to the end of the current period. Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the Account Settings screen in the App Store app on your device after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during the active subscription period.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND ARBITRATION SECTION PROVIDES THAT ANY DISPUTE ARISING FROM THESE TERMS OF USE MAY BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, WHICH REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT. THIS SECTION ALSO PROHIBITS YOU FROM BRINGING A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN COURT, AND PROHIBITS YOU FROM BRINGING ANY CLAIM IN ARBITRATION AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. IN ADDITION, THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND ARBITRATION SECTION PROHIBITS YOUR ABILITY TO BE PART OF ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION BROUGHT BY ANYONE ELSE, AND PROHIBITS YOUR ABILITY TO BE REPRESENTED IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. THE WAIVERS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 5.2 INCLUDE ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST AESOPICAS WITH RESPECT TO ANY THIRD PARTY SERVICE. TO THE EXTENT A PROVIDER OF A THIRD PARTY SERVICE JOINS AESOPICAS IN ANY ACTION BETWEEN YOU AND SUCH PROVIDER, YOU AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 5.2 SHALL APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST AESOPICAS.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Any failure or other delay by either party in enforcing this Section at any time, or in connection with any particular Claims, will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims. Decisions rendered in arbitration proceedings will be final and binding on the parties. There shall be no appeal from arbitration decisions other than for arbitrator bias, fraud or misconduct and any award granted in arbitration will be enforceable by any court having jurisdiction as provided by the FAA and/or other applicable law.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This Section shall survive: (i) termination of, or changes in, the Software Purchase Agreement, the EULA or these Terms of Use and any relationship between you and us; (ii) the bankruptcy of any party or any other similar proceeding initiated by you or on your behalf; and (iii) payment in full of any debt by you or by a third party. Should any portion of this Section be deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions shall nevertheless remain in force. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Use to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this Section (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section.</span></p>
